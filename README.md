# MeliTestApp
MeliTestApp is an iOS app that demonstrates the implementation of three main components: SearchView, Table List, and Detail View. These components allow users to search for products, view search results in a table, and see detailed information about a selected product.

## Features
The app has the following main features:

1. **SearchView**: Users can enter a search query to find products.

2. **Table List**: The search results are displayed in a table list format. Each item in the table represents a product and provides essential information about it.

3. **Detail View**: When a user taps on a product in the table list, they are taken to the Detail View, which presents more detailed information about the selected product, including a product image, title, and price.

## Requirements
iOS 16.4+
Xcode 14.3.1+

## Installation

4. The Table List will display the search results as a list of products.
